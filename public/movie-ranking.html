<h1>Kristi's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>Here are my all-time favorite movies in no particular order.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</h3>
<p>This is my family's favorite movie. We can quote the whole movie.</p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>It's new but it blew me away. I saw it four times in the theater and could watch over and over.</p>

<h3>Breakfast at Tiffany's</h3>
<p>It's a cliche but so charming and I wouldn't miss it while it was on.</p>

<h3>Bonus: Wizard of Oz</h3>
<p>It just reminds me of being young.</p>
